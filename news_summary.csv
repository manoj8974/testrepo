2,"From her special numbers to TV?appearances, Bollywood actor Malaika Arora Khan has managed to carve her own identity. The actor, who made her debut in the Hindi film industry with the blockbuster debut opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Chaiyya Chaiyya from Dil Se (1998), is still remembered for the song. However, for trolls, she is a woman first and what matters right now is that she divorced a ?rich man?.  On Wednesday, Malaika Arora shared a gorgeous picture of herself on Instagram and a follower decided to troll her for using her ?alumni?

Apart from being a successful woman who lives life on her own terms, Malaika has literally played all the roles traditionally prescribed for a woman - she married quite early, had a son and raised him and was always around with the ?khandan?. But then, she got divorced and alimony is the taunt being thrown at her. The details of the alimony are only known to Malaika, her husband Arbaaz Khan and perhaps the family. The couple has handled the divorce with the utmost dignity.

If anything, she is as successful, if not more, than her ex-husband.What happened between Arbaaz and Malaika is their personal concern.

5,"Hotels in Mumbai and other Indian cities are to train their staff to spot signs of sex trafficking such as frequent requests for bed linen changes or a ""Do not disturb"" sign left on the door for days on end. The group behind the initiative is also developing a mobile phone app - Rescue Me - which hotel staff can use to alert local police and senior anti-trafficking officers if they see suspicious behavior. ""Hotels are breeding grounds for human trade,"" said Sanee Awsarmmel, chairman of the alumni group of Maharashtra State Institute of Hotel Management and Catering Technology. ""(We) have hospitality professionals working in hotels across the country. We are committed to this cause.""The initiative, spearheaded by the alumni group and backed by the Maharashtra state government, comes amid growing international recognition that hotels have a key role to play in fighting modern day slavery. MAHARASHTRA MAJOR DESTINATION FOR TRAFFICKED GIRLS Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital, is a major destination for trafficked girls who are lured from poor states and nearby countries on the promise of jobs, but then sold into the sex trade or domestic servitude. With rising property prices, some traditional red light districts like those in Mumbai have started to disappear pushing the sex trade underground into private lodges and hotels, which makes it hard for police to monitor.Awsarmmel said hotels would be told about 50 signs that staff needed to watch out for.These include requests for rooms with a view of the car park which are favored by traffickers as they allow them to vet clients for signs of trouble and check out their cars to gauge how much to charge.Awsarmmel said hotel staff often noticed strange behavior such as a girl's reticence during the check-in process or her dependence on the person accompanying her to answer questions and provide her proof of identity.But in most cases, staff ignore these signs or have no idea what to do, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.RESCUE ME APP The Rescue Me app - to be launched in a couple of months - will have a text feature where hotel staff can fill in details including room numbers to send an alert to police.Human trafficking is the world's fastest growing criminal enterprise worth an estimated $150 billion a year, according to the International Labor Organization, which says nearly 21 million people globally are victims of forced labor and trafficking.Last year, major hotel groups, including the Hilton and Shiva Hotels, pledged to examine their supply chains for forced labor, and train staff how to spot and report signs of trafficking.Earlier this year, Mexico City also launched an initiative to train hotel staff about trafficking.Vijaya Rahatkar, chairwoman of the Maharashtra State Women's Commission, said the initiative would have an impact beyond the state as the alumni group had contact with about a million small hotels across India.The group is also developing a training module on trafficking for hotel staff and hospitality students which could be used across the country.ALSO READFYI | Legal revenge: Child sex trafficking survivors get 'School of Justice' to fight their own battlesMumbai: Woman DJ arrested in high-profile sex racket case","Hotels in Maharashtra will train their staff to spot signs of sex trafficking, including frequent requests for bed linen changes and 'Do not disturb' signs left on room doors for days.

7,"In an interesting ruling, the Delhi high court reduced the compensation awarded to a motor accident victim by 45 per cent after it found negligence on the part of both the parties.Deepak Kumar, the victim, was hit by a motor vehicle driven by a government employee named Ajay Kumar in Palam.Deepak told the court that while he was on his way to work, he stopped his vehicle after crossing Palam flyover to feed a cow. While he was crossing the road, he was hit and suffered injuries. The trial court had awarded a compensation of Rs 10 lakh to him after ruling negligence on Ajay's part.Ajay challenged the trial court order based on the detailed accident report that mentioned motorcycle was not being driven dangerously or at an excessive speed, and was being driven in its lane and within the permissible speed limit.He sought examination of the contributory negligence on behalf of the injured through advocate Trideep Pais and Pranav Jain. The court observed, ""It is possible that despite the vehicle being driven in permissible limit, an accident can occur when a jaywalker suddenly appears on the road.""""Such people apart from impairing their own lives also pose a threat to the safety and security of the ongoing traffic. The fact that the victim chose to walk across a busy road near the airport, with heavy morning traffic, he knowingly exposed himself to dangers that such risk may entail. It exhibits his negligence towards his own safety,"" the court added.Quoting the detailed accident report, the court said if the vehicle was in good condition, being driven in the right lane at the right speed, the accident which was caused at a non-zebra crossing, could be attributed to the sudden appearance of the jaywalker in front of the vehicle.In the circumstances, a portion of the blame and negligence would have to be shared by the claimant. While noting that there was a fair chance of the accident being avoided if the vehicle was being driven at the permissible limit and maintaining fair distance with the vehicle moving ahead of it, the court said, "" One has also to bear in mind that not all city roads are carefully marked for pedestrian or zebra crossing.""""The time of the accident was about 9.40 am. The visibility was clear. The appellant could have well seen from some distance the movement of the pedestrian crossing the road,"" the court added.","The Delhi High Court reduced the compensation awarded to a motor accident victim by 45% after it found negligence on the part of both parties.

8," A 60-year old Dalit woman was allegedly lynched in Agra after villagers thought she was out to cut the hair of sleeping women, the first reported fatality of what appears to be turning into a case of mass hysteria.Growing number of people, particularly in rural districts, of Haryana, Rajasthan, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have reported mysterious instances of sleeping women being attacked and their hair chopped off short.  Family members said Maan Devi left the home around 4am on Wednesday but lost her way, reaching a predominantly upper caste neighbourhood where people spotted her. ?She pleaded that she had lost her way but they took as one responsible for chopping women hair in Mutnai village and killed her,? said the victim?s daughter-in-law Kalpana Jatav.Local police first denied the death was connected to the ?ghost barber? panic. Deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Fatehabad, Dr Tej Veer Singh said a case was registered including charges relating to atrocities against Dalits, and teams were keeping a vigil in the area where the woman was killed.  The police also appeared to deny that the woman was beaten to death. ?The post-mortem report of Maan Devi indicates she died of cardiac arrest and not due to beating,? Singh said. Devi?s son has named two suspects, both from the upper caste Baghel community, in his complaint where he also said that his mother?s body had been thrown back in their village. Till Thursday, neither was arrested.Agra and villages in districts nearby were the latest to report the hair-cutting mystery that seems to be spreading since first being recorded in parts of the National Capital Region last week. Officials said on Friday that more ?sightings? were reported from the region, and the state?s Inspector General issued an appeal for people to remain calm.Women in at least five states have reported waking up to the sound of scissors, spotting black cats, and seeing ghosts and shadows. Some claimed they found portions of their hair chopped off, and others reported falling unconscious with fear.Police have dismissed the allegations as rumours in several of these cases, and administration officials are now issuing alerts for local law enforcement to tackle fear mongering. FROM MONKEY MAN TO UFOsParts of India, particularly rural districts where superstitious beliefs are common, have often been at the centre of mass hysteria events. In the summer of 2001, people in Delhi said they had spotted a mysterious monkey-like creature that appeared in the night and attacked people. Large colonies of the capital were gripped by fear as more and more bizarre ?sightings? were recorded. Vigilante groups patrolled the streets with sticks for weeks, before officials and psychiatric experts said the panic was created by ?figments of people?s imagination? that was made worse by the media coverage at the time.A year later, people in Eastern Uttar Pradesh reported spotting a light-emitting flying object that would attack them at night and scratch their face. Many referred to it as the ?muhnochwa?, a Bhojpuri amalgam that loosely translates to ?face snatcher?. At the height of the panic, people went off streets after sundown. Scientists from IIT Kanpur were roped in to investigate the event, and the ruled out the existence of the creature. The closest explanation, they said, could have been sightings of ball lightening, a rare meteorological phenomenon. Years earlier, in 1995, a more innocuous mass delusion took place when people across the country reported seeing idols of the Hindu god Ganesha drinking milk.

Unitech Cyber Park Sector 39, Unitech Business Zone and Nirvana Country Yard Sector 50 and Unitech Arcadia Sector 49 will also offer free parking.Omaxe City Centre, Omaxe Mall, Raheja Mall, ILD Trade Centre, Omaxe Celebration Mall and the Sapphire Mall on Sohna Road are also on the list.?The MCG had the option of levying a property tax on the basements in commercial centres, but after reading the Central government guidelines, an option was given to building owners that if they did not levy a parking fee on customers, the property tax on basements will be waived. Hence, for the public?s benefit, the MCG has placed ?free parking? boards at these sites for their awareness,? MCG Commissioner V Umashankar said.If the sites mentioned on the list are found levying a parking fee, the public can report complaints on the MCG?s toll-free number ? 1800-180-1817 ? or email to support@mcg.gov.in.","Municipal Corporation of Gurugram on Wednesday said that 19 out of 45 commercial building owners have decided to pay property tax instead of providing free parking to the public. Notably, MCG earlier offered a property tax waiver for building basements if they were used to provide free parking. However, the owners allegedly said that revenues from parking profited them more.",
14,"Scientists have modified human embryos to remove genetic mutations that cause heart failure in otherwise healthy young people in a landmark demonstration of the controversial procedure.It is the first time that human embryos have had their genomes edited outside China, where researchers have performed a handful of small studies to see whether the approach could prevent inherited diseases from being passed on from one generation to the next.While none of the research so far has created babies from modified embryos, a move that would be illegal in many countries, the work represents a milestone in scientists? efforts to master the technique and brings the prospect of human clinical trials one step closer.The work focused on an inherited form of heart disease, but scientists believe the same approach could work for other conditions caused by single gene mutations, such as cystic fibrosis and certain kinds of breast cancer.?This embryo gene correction method, if proven safe, can potentially be used to prevent transmission of genetic disease to future generations,? said Paula Amato, a fertility specialist involved in the US-Korean study at Oregon Health and Science University.The scientists used a powerful gene editing tool called Crispr-Cas9 to fix mutations in embryos made with the sperm of a man who inherited a heart condition known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or HCM. The disease, which leads to a thickening of the heart?s muscular wall, affects one in 500 people and is a common cause of sudden cardiac arrest in young people.Crispr, or to give it its full name, Crispr-Cas9, allows scientists to precisely target and edit pieces of the genome. Crispr is a guide molecule made of RNA, that allows a specific site of interest on the DNA double helix to be targeted. The RNA molecule is attached to Cas9, a bacterial enzyme that works as a pair of ""molecular scissors"" to cut the DNA at the exact point required. This allows scientists to cut, paste and delete single letters of genetic code. Humans have two copies of every gene, but some diseases are caused by a mutation in only one of the copies. For the study, the scientists recruited a man who carried a single mutant copy of a gene called MYBPC3 which causes HCM.When the scientists made embryos with the man?s sperm and healthy eggs from donors, they found that, as expected, about half of the embryos carried the mutant gene. If the affected embryos were implanted into women and carried to term, the resulting children would inherit the heart condition.Writing in the journal Nature, the researchers describe how gene editing dramatically reduced the number of embryos that carried the dangerous mutation. When performed early enough, at the same time as fertilisation, 42 out of 58 embryos, or 72%, were found to be free of the disease-causing mutation.The work has impressed other scientists in the field because in previous experiments, gene editing has worked only partially, mending harmful mutations in some cells, but not others. Another problem happens when the wrong genes are modified by mistake, but in the latest work the scientists found no evidence of these so-called ?off target effects??They?ve got remarkably good results, it?s a big advance.? said Richard Hynes, a geneticist at MIT who this year co-chaired a major report on human genome editing for the US National Academy of Sciences (NAS). ?This brings it closer to clinic, but there?s still a lot of work to do.?Today, people who carry certain genetic diseases can opt for IVF and have their embryos screened for harmful mutations. The procedure can only help if there is a chance that some embryos will be healthy. According to Shoukhrat Mitalipov, who led the latest research, gene editing could bolster the number of healthy embryos available for doctors to implant.More work is needed to prove that gene editing would be safe to do in people, but even if it seems safe, scientists face major regulatory hurdles before clinical trials could start. In the US, Congress has barred the Food and Drug Administration from even considering human trials with edited embryos, while in the UK it is illegal to implant genetically modified embryos in women. The procedure is controversial because genetic modifications made to an embryo affect not only the child it becomes but future generations too. ?It?s still a long road ahead,? said Mitalipov. ?It?s unclear when we?d be allowed to move on.?In the latest study, the mutation was corrected by a route that scientists have not seen before, with the cell copying healthy DNA from the mother?s egg instead of the template. One question scientists need to explore now is whether mutations carried by eggs can be corrected as easily as those carried by sperm.?If all of this holds up for different genes and is also true when the mutation is inherited from the mother, it will be a major step forward,? said Janet Rossant, senior scientist and chief of research emeritus at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.Asked about the potential for gene editing to produce designer babies, Rossant, a co-author of the NAS report on gene editing, said it was a distant prospect. ?We are still a long way from serious consideration of using gene editing to enhance traits in babies,? she said. ?We don?t understand the genetic basis of many of the human traits that might be targets for enhancement. Even if we did, a genetic alteration that enhanced one trait could have unexpected negative consequences on other traits, and this would be an inherited feature for the next generation.??The NAS report came out strongly against any form of gene editing designed to simply enhance human potential,? she added.","Scientists, for the first time, successfully freed embryos of a piece of faulty DNA that causes a fatal heart disease to run in families. The disease, called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, causes the heart to stop suddenly and is the result of an error in a single gene. The breakthrough could lead to preventing 10,000 disorders that are passed down the generations.",

16,"The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to stay the Election Commission decision allowing the NOTA provision in the August 8 Rajya Sabha polls in Gujarat.A bench of justices Dipak Misra, Amitava Roy and AM Khanwilkar, however, agreed to examine the constitutional validity of the August 1 notification of the poll panel allowing the NOTA option.?Issue notice. We will examine it. We are not going to stay the proceedings,? the bench said when senior advocates Kapil Sibal, AM Singhvi and Harin Raval, representingGujarat Congress chief whip Shailesh Manubhai Parmar, sought an interim stay on the notification.The bench questioned the delay by the opposition party in filing its petition, pointing out that the poll panel had issued a notification on the matter in January 2014 and another circular in 2015.?When it suited you, you did not come. You come here on the eve of elections,? the bench said.Sibal told the court that including NOTA will encourage corruption. ?It?s a recipe for corruption.?The NOTA ? none of the above ? option allows voters to reject all candidates in fray. Six Gujarat MLAs switched over from the Congress to the BJP last week, seen as a major blow to the prospects of the opposition party candidate Ahmed Patel.The Congress is apprehensive of cross voting and some MLAs exercising the NOTA option.Last week, the party flew most of its Gujarat  MLAs to Bengaluru to protect them from what it says is the BJP?s conspiracy to lure Congress legislators. The petition said use of the option would be violative of the provisions of the Representation of People?s Act, 1951 and the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.In the Rajya Sabha polls, the MLAs have to show their ballot paper to an authorised party agent before putting it in ballot box.If a voter (MLA) defies the party directive and casts the ballot for someone else or uses the NOTA option, he cannot be disqualified as a legislator.But the party is free to take disciplinary action including expulsion. The defiant voter can continue to be an MLA and his vote can also not be invalidated for defying the party direction, according to EC rules. (With agency inputs)",The Supreme Court today refused to stay the exercise of NOTA (none of the above) option in the Gujarat Rajya Sabha elections scheduled to take place on 8 August. The SC further said that the issue would be heard as a constitutional question ? whether NOTA would apply to election of council of states. ,

24,"Newly released data and photos show how shockingly low an Air Canada jet was when it pulled up to avoid crashing into planes waiting on a San Francisco international airport taxiway last month. The Air Canada pilots mistook the taxiway for the runway next to it and flew their jet to just 59ft (18m) above ground before pulling up to attempt another landing, according to National Transportation Safety Board information released on Wednesday.That?s barely taller than the four planes that were on the taxiway when the incident occurred late at night on 7 July. Pilots in a United plane alerted air traffic controllers about the off-course jet, while the crew of a Philippine Airlines jet behind it switched on their plane?s landing lights in an apparent last-ditch danger signal to Air Canada. NTSB investigators said they have not determined probable cause for the incident that came within a few feet of becoming one of the worst disasters in aviation history.?It was close, much too close,? said John Cox, a safety consultant and retired airline pilot.The investigators said that as the Air Canada jet approached the taxiway just before midnight after a flight from Toronto, it was so far off course that it did not appear on a radar system used to prevent runway collisions.Those systems were not designed to spot planes that are lined up to land on a taxiway a rare occurrence, especially for airline pilots. But the Federal Aviation Administration is working on modifications so they can, agency spokesman Ian Gregor said.Both pilots of the Air Canada Airbus A320 jet were very experienced. The captain, who was flying the plane, had more than 20,000 hours of flying time, and the co-pilot had about 10,000 hours.The pilots told investigators ?that they did not recall seeing aircraft on taxiway but that something did not look right to them,? the NTSB said.Investigators could not hear what the Air Canada captain and co-pilot said to each other during the aborted landing because their conversation was recorded over when the plane made other flights, starting with a San Francisco-to-Montreal trip the next morning. Recorders are required to capture only the last two hours of a plane?s flying time.Peter Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for Air Canada, declined to comment, citing the investigation.

Airoli and Vikhroli wetlands ? among 12 unique mangrove forests in the country.Mangrove forests grow in creeks, estuaries, bays and lagoons and in inter-tidal areas ? area between the high tide and the low tide. Their ecosystem is believed to have evolved around 114 million years back in tropical and subtropical regions and India  has 3% (4,740 sq km) of the world?s mangrove cover. The unique mangroves located along India?s 7,516-km coastline are in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The world?s largest mangrove forests in Sunderbans, West Bengal, are also featured in the list. The list was released by the MSI and the Goa state biodiversity board  at the National Mangrove Conference in Dona Paula, Goa last week. Maharashtra is the only state to have a dedicated cell protecting its mangrove cover.?Mangroves are under threat from developmental projects and we are failing to understand the value of safeguarding the coastline from disasters and their economic value when it comes to tourism. We do not have the concept of preservation in India,? said Arvind Untawale, secretary, MSI. ?The idea behind selecting these 12 locations is to enhance conservation and protection of different mangrove species, the biodiversity and establish them as international tourism destinations.?He added that tigers in Sunderbans, saltwater crocodiles in Odisha, and birds, fish, crabs, and the unique flora present in this ecosystem are not getting enough attention from the Centre. ?There is great potential for adventure, research, information, conservation and management aspects, which the tourism sector needs to focus upon,? said Untawale.Mangroves in?Vikhroli.

The hotelier-turned-POTUS reportedly told members of his Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster, New Jersey, that he preferred staying at his own properties rather than at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, because the executive mansion is ?a real dump?, the Washington Post reported, citing the article on Golf.com as saying.Trump, in a May interview with Time magazine, had praised the White House for its ?beautiful kitchen?, ?amazing? phone system and ?incredible? historical furniture. ?People have no idea the beauty of the White House.

34,"A suspected British prankster appears to have conned White House officials including Anthony Scaramucci into replying to him after pretending in email correspondence to be several different members of the Trump team.The man, who goes by the Twitter handle @SINON_REBORN, posed as Jared Kushner well enough to convince homeland security adviser Tom Bossert to reply to him, according to CNN. Bossert included his personal email address in the exchange.Named director of communications after having been denied a White House role earlier, the New York financier and Republican fundraiser promptly threatened to fire everyone in his team over leaks. He also staged a combative and contradictory briefing room debut and talkshow tour; sought to bat away questions about suspiciously liberal pronouncements in his past and support for Trump?s Republican enemies; deleted tweets; warred openly with the former chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and seemingly forced him out; compared the struggle to take healthcare away from millions of Americans to Lincoln?s battle against slavery; poured obscene invective about leakers, Priebus and Steve Bannon down the phone to a New Yorker reporter; missed the birth of his son; saw his wife file for divorce; and was asked to resign.Trump?s first national security adviser ? one of four generals the president has employed ? resigned after it was revealed he misled Vice-President Mike Pence over his contacts with Russians during the election campaign. It was later reported that Yates had warned the White House Flynn was vulnerable to Russian blackmail.The most shocking firing of them all. Trump sacked his FBI director, by messenger rather than in person, as congressional and justice department investigations into links between Trump aides and Russia gathered pace. Lest anyone retain any doubt about why Trump pressed the big red button, he told NBC in a primetime interview the firing was tied to ?this Russia thing?. The reverberations will be felt for some time yet.The long-suffering but loyal surrogate for the president handed in his resignationin response to Scaramucci?s appointment. A Republican insider and Priebus ally, he never settled into the press secretary role after an infamous debut in which he angrily insisted Trump?s fantastic version of crowd sizes at the inauguration were true. Achieving by way of Melissa McCarthy?s lethal Saturday Night Live impression a somewhat dubious celebrity, his days at the White House were long rumoured to be numbered. His departure on a point of principle having seemingly been justified only 10 days later, he may now claim a sort of hollow vindication.The former Republican National Committee chair stayed loyal ? at least in public ? to Trump through Friday, when he was told his time was up. He stayed loyal after handing in his resignation too, rhapsodising about the president and his mission in interviews with CNN and, of course, Fox News. But it seemed Priebus?s card had alway been marked, less over his initial blocking of Scaramucci, which enraged the Mooch, or by his closeness to the House speaker, Paul Ryan, than by his private advice to Trump to quit the presidential race after 8 October, when the infamous Access Hollywood ?Gropegate? tape was published. The Washington Post reported that Priebus was thus never considered a member of the ?Oct 8th coalition?, a name for the inner cabal of Trumpites who have never wavered, however low their boss?s reputation has sunk.The man also fooled Scaramucci, the White House communications director who was fired on Monday, by pretending to be Reince Priebus, the former Trump administration chief of staff with whom he was believed to be in open warfare.In a series of emails, the man posing as Priebus baited Scaramucci, accusing him of being ?breathtakingly hypocritical? and saying ?at no stage have you acted in a way that is remotely classy?.Scaramucci responded: ?You know what you did. We all do. Even today. But rest assured we were prepared. A Man would apologize.?The heated exchange continued, with the prankster writing: ?I can?t believe you are questioning my ethics! The so called ?Mooch?, who can?t even manage his first week in the White House without leaving upset in his wake. I have nothing to apologize for.?Scaramucci replied: ?Read Shakespeare. Particularly Othello. You are right there. My family is fine by the way and will thrive. I know what you did. No more replies from me.?

She urged the Supreme Court to take notice of the matter for the sake of the honour of women members of the PTI as there is speculation that Khan might one day become the prime minister.

39,"A recent study has found a substantial presence in the ultrafine particulate matter PM1, a dangerous pollutant, in Central Delhi.The PM 1 particle is 70 times finer than the thickness of a human hair, goes directly into the bloodstream and is potentially more dangerous than the more well known PM2.5 and PM10 pollutants. And no one knows how much of it is in the air we breathe.The Lodhi Road monitoring station of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) under the Ministry of Earth Sciences has recorded the average volume of PM1 during summer, winter and the monsoon at about 46, 49 and 20 micrograms per cubic metres, respectively. The data from the year 2016 is collected in the only station that has the technology, says Gufran Beig, project director of SAFAR.The safe standards of PM1 have not been defined yet, in the absence of which its potentially harmful effects have not been documented. Globally, too, there might not be a standard but PM1 is considered the most dangerous among all particulate matter, particularly because of its size. It measures around 1 micron or less in diameter and can enter deep into the lungs and bloodstream.According to a Central Pollution Control Board 2010 study, small particulate matter can reach the alveolar region, causing heart ailments. These fine particles cover a large surface area, absorb toxic compounds such as heavy metals and organic compounds with high carbon content, the study said.These particles ? spewed primarily from vehicles, factories and construction sites ? are not dispersed and stay suspended in the air.But why is the air in Central Delhi flooded with these particulates??PM1 is a major product of vehicular combustion. Roads in and around the Lodhi Road area like other parts of Lutyens? Delhi see a huge flow of vehicles. This might be the reason behind the prevalence of this finer particulate matter. It also depends on where the station is located, the dispersion capacity, meteorological factors, among others,? Dr Dipankar Saha, additional director and head of the Air Laboratory at the CPCB told Hindustan Times.","Substantial presence of PM1, reportedly the most dangerous particulate matter, has been found in areas around Delhi's Lodhi Road, a study by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research said.

42,"After accusing director Anees Bazme and his friend and associate Mayur Barot for non-payment of dues, comedian Sunil Pal is now planning to take legal action against both of them. However, Anees completely denies the charges. ?About eight months back I was asked by Anees Bazmee and his friend Mayur Barot to perform at a family function (in Mumbai). They told me I will be paid a certain amount later. But I never got my payment. And while Anees Bazmi got busy with his film, Mubarakan, Barot kept on telling me that they were getting a cheque drawn out for me. After so much of drama when nothing happened, I even messaged Anees Bazmi saying that I am planning to file a police compliant. I was shocked when he replied that I can do whatever I want to and that it won?t affect him,? says Sunil, adding both of them even said that they would cast him in their films but that too never happened. Meanwhile, the comedian-actor also contacted Cine And TV Artistes Association (CINTAA) and they had asked him to come with a written complaint. But Sunil never went to the cops because he thought that filing a case would take too much time. He therefore decided to make a video with a message for Bazmee and shared it on his Facebook page. In the video he says that he is sorry that Mubarakan didn?t work, and that its God?s way of showing justice to those who wrong others.?I made the video and sent it to Anees Bazmee around noon on Monday but he didn?t reply. So I thought I must upload it on Facebook. Some people have come to my support. Now I am planning to take legal action against both of them. I won?t let them get away like this,? adds Sunil of The Great Indian Laughter Challenge fame.Director Anees Bazmee denied the allegation brought against him by Sunil Pal.When we got in touch with Bazmee he said that the deal happened between Mayur and Sunil and he has nothing to do in it. ?I was just a mediator, who introduced them, beyond that I know nothing. Why will I do something like this for such a small amount? Sunil used to visit my Mumbai office and he was looking for work. Also I never promised to cast him in my film,? says the Welcome Back (2015) director. Voicing a similar opinion, Barot points out that the reason Sunil has dragged Bazmee?s name is because he is a well-known person. ?Sir (Anees Bazmi) has nothing to do with it. Sunil was looking for work and wanted to perform at this function. There was no discussion regarding remuneration. But then after sometime he said he wants his payment and even used foul language when I refused. His false accusation is defamatory for someone like me who is just starting his journey (he is producing Remo Dsouza?s film Nawabzade) in Bollywood.

It is not believed to involve fraud.However, a statement attributed by the Times to Mackenzie?s son, Peter Mackenzie, said his father had a serious health issue and had resigned.

His previous roles include chairman and chief executive of National Car Parks and its subsidiary Green Flag, a rival car breakdown business.The AA said Mackenzie?s responsibilities would be split, with Simon Breakwell, a non-executive director since 2014 and a founder of the travel company Expedia, appointed as acting chief executive.

This was especially true in June and July which saw significant spikes in demand.?We now expect the full-year performance to be broadly in line with that of the last financial year.?The AA said paid members totalled 3.33 million in the first six months of the year, an increase of 6,000 compared with the same period a year earlier.

57,"It took him five years and lot of courage to openly speak about his battle with drug addiction. After making a promising start in Bollywood, Prateik Babbar vanished from the limelight for a good five years. His absence might not have caught anybody's attention, but his return has grabbed many eyeballs. And why not? For the first time, the 30-year-old actor has openly spoken about his battle with substance abuse. When many actors shy away from talking about their issues, Prateik has come out in the open, talking about his his long battle with addiction. In an interview to Mumbai Mirror, the actor talked about addiction, recovery and his career. This is what he said. On addiction He has come to terms with complications of his life and has fought the demons of substance abuse. It was last year when he first talked about his drug addiction, and in the last one year, he has been a ""work in progress"". ""Addiction is not a moral failing, it does not make you a bad person even if you have made a poor choice. People still think I got hooked because it was 'cool' for a celebrity to indulge in recreational drugs. But for me, it was more of an escape from reality. My childhood was complicated and there were a lot of questions I didn't have answers to so I looked elsewhere for solace,"" said Prateik.  On acceptanceIt took him a while to understand that he was an addict, and he needed to get out of it as soon as possible. ""Acceptance and speaking up can help change the face of addiction. It educates those who are ailing and tells others that the stereotype of people suffering is the exception rather than the rule. Acceptance is one of the first steps to recovery,"" added the actor. On coming outPrateik came out in open about his addiction as he didn't want to keep his fans in the dark. He wanted them to be aware of the dark truth of his life. ""I'm a fighter and criticism is not an option for me. Yes, one is entitled to his/her opinion and it's human to be judgmental but everyone deserves a second chance. The idea is to move on. I want to create awareness by showcasing the boy uninterrupted so the world doesn't get to see just one side of the story,"" said the 30-year-old actor. On recoveryIt has taken him a few years to get back to his normal life and he says that with each passing day, he is making an effort to better his life. He said, ""I'm still on the road to recovery but I'm proud to have turned over a new leaf. Substance abuse is like a bad marriage, even after you quit, it haunts you for a while till people start noticing the turnaround. I'm answerable to only my conscience. And yes, people take me more seriously now that I'm no longer the hippie rave but someone committed to fitness, auditions and family.""On his careerHe began his career with the 2008 film Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na, and went onto bag a few promising roles in the subsequent years. However, it's been almost five years since Prateik has been seen on the big screen. But the actor is all set to bounce back. ""I'm looking for quality work and am not embarrassed to go out and ask for it. I'm also doing a lot of theatre with Jeff Goldberg because I believe it polishes your acting skills,"" he added. ","Actor Prateik Babbar, while speaking about dealing with drug addiction, said substance abuse is like a bad marriage. ""[E]ven after you quit, it haunts you for a while till people start noticing the turnaround,"" he added. Prateik further said, ""Addiction is not a moral failing, it doesn't make you a bad person even if you have made a poor choice"".",
58,"The CBFC (Central Board of Film Certification) seems to have forgotten that their job is to certify, not censor. The latest victim of their scissors is Nawazuddin Siddiqui-starrer Babumoshai Bandookbaaz. The Pahlaj Nihalani-led board ordered a whopping 48 cuts to the film, and when India Today Television reached out to him, he said, ""We are just doing our job.""But this is not the worst of it. Disparaging sexist comments were allegedly made by CBFC members about the producer, Kiran Shroff, for green-lighting a film with such 'abusive' content. According to a report in Bombay Times, a female member asked her how she, as a woman, could be involved in the making of a film with so many abuses. At this point, a male member is said to have interjected, ""Inhone to pant-shirt pehni hai. Yeh aurat thodi hi hain.""Kiran told the publication, ""They had an internal discussion for an hour after the screening. First, they told us that they were giving us an A certificate. Then they told us that there are 48 cuts. We argued that if the film is for adults, then why have so many cuts. They didn't bother much, and continued to explain each cut and their logic behind it.""She added, ""In the middle of that, a lady officer turned to me and said, 'Aap aurat hokar aisi filmein kaise bana sakti hain'. And before I could speak up, a man in the committee said, 'But she is not a woman. Look at what she is wearing.' I was dumbfounded. This is such a regressive thought... Sadly, this is the kind of humiliation producers have to put up with. If they are judging me by my clothes, I can imagine the parameters they must have used to pass my film.""Babumoshai Bandookbaaz has been directed to do away with abusive words as well as 80 per cent of its ""humping"" scenes. Director Kushan Nandy was appalled and told the daily, ""First and foremost, we don't have humping scenes. They are love-making scenes. I am shocked and appalled with what has happened. If you notice the cuts, there's a sentence, 'Yeh kaahe ka c******a hai'. We use such sentences in our everyday life. The excuse given to us is that children also sneak into cinema halls to watch adult films. How is that my problem? Penalise the cinema halls for this, not the producers. The way they have dealt with our film is insulting. They humiliated Kiran which is unpardonable.""Apparently, the filmmaker has been asked to get rid of a bunch of sentences with the word ""khada"" in it. He met Pahlaj Nihalani in private to discuss the directives, but the CBFC chief had a shocking response - ""You are lucky I'm not banning your film.""Kushan said, ""When I argued that there are no grounds to do that, he retorted, 'What are these abuses? Do you plan to make a dictionary of bad words?' He even asked me to change lines like 'Maa ka lehenga' to 'Maa ka anchal'. In short, the essence of what is being said is lost. He told me, 'C*****a ko tutiya kar do.' He is basically trying to teach us to make a film. And finally, he told me to remove the line that has 'Khada' in it. He said, 'I will never let it pass because I am abused for my song Khada Hai Khada Hai to this day.' I'll fight this till the end.""Pahlaj Nihalani refused to comment on the matter.At a media interaction today, Kiran Shroff shared all that the CBFC members told her. One CBFC board member asked Kiran Shroff(producer) 'Why as a woman have you made this film?: Kushan Nandy,director #BabumoshaiBandookbaazThen another CBFC board member said 'ye to pant shirt pehne huye hain woman thodi hain': Kushan Nandy,director #BabumoshaiBandookbaazThey(CBFC) told us that we have given 48 cuts in the film: Kiran Shroff,Producer #BabumoshaiBandookbaazpic.twitter.com/NbFBDWZHSpThen Pahlaj Nihalani came and told me that I am lucky that my film is not banned: Kushan Nandy,Director #BabumoshaiBandookbaazpic.twitter.com/RHBxREjM4f","Producer of 'Babumoshai Bandookbaaz' Kiran Shroff, while talking about sexist comments she faced, has said that a Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) member asked her how she could make a film like this being a woman.

Sana walked the red carpet at a recently held TV awards show in Mumbai, and when she spotted Salman, the two exchanged a hug. What made it news was Salman?s closed fists, and his shy smile. ?I still can?t believe that a normal hug was trending, trolling, and rolling,? says Sana. ?People just blew it out of proportion because [Salman] had a closed fist, and some dumb people even called it an awkward hug.?

It?s not [as if] I went to hug him and he didn?t recognise me.?But why that closed fist? ?Couldn?t it be somebody?s style? Maybe he hugs like that. I don?t know. I think the best person [whom] to ask this would be Salman. [Also] He has been in the [film] industry for over 25 years, so don?t think backless even matters to him? he has seen more than that (laughs).

Sana says, ?Well, could be. Maybe he didn?t want my back bronzer to fall on his clothes. He has worked with all sexy and good-looking actresses, who would use bronzer from head to toe, so he knows that. And it?s not that he wants to feel me up or I want to feel him up.

60,"Actor Dia Mirza, who was in Delhi to walk for designer Anju Modi at the India Couture Week 2017, has not just a lovely face but also a strong mind. And that is something Twitter trolls couldn?t digest. In this era of non-stop trolling, Dia recalls how, in her early days in Bollywood, she was targeted for expressing her opinion on various issues. In recent times, Dia?s tweets have advocated water conservation on Holi and a noise-free Diwali. ?In the earlier days, when I did get trolled, it really affected and frightened me. Because when you?re told that people want to throw acid on you, or they want to rape you, or kill you, or call you anti-national because of something that you?ve said... and they ask you to move to another country... and it?s all new to you, then it really alarms you,? she says. The 35-year-old actor was trolled  on social media  when she had tweeted and urged her fans to play a dry Holi. She had written: ?The irony of the times we live in: farmers commit suicide due to drought and people waste water to ?play? #Holi. Go ahead call me anti-Hindu.? The trolls were quick to tag her as anti-national. Dia was also called intolerant when she had tweeted about wanting a cracker-free Diwali. Now, after so many years in Bollywood, Dia takes such crude reactions in her stride. The actor states that she has always voiced her opinion on issues that deeply matter to her. ?I have continued to express my opinion. I reserve my opinion for things that truly matter to me. And when you express your opinion on something that deeply matters to you, it doesn?t matter how people construe it,? she says. ?I feel that those elements on social media who are faceless and nameless, who make it their business to harass people, [don?t] need to be taken seriously. I?ve been in the public sphere long enough now to understand that we need to be like ducks and let this [trolling] be like water sliding off our backs. The only thing that matters is our own truth. The intent is what should matter,? adds the actor. Dia will be seen next in the Sanjay Dutt biopic by Rajkumar Hirani; she plays the role of Maanyata, Dutt?s wife. Speaking about her film and working with Hirani ? he is the director of such blockbusters as Lage Raho Munnabhai (2006), 3 Idiots (2009), and PK (2014) ?  Dia says, ?Rajkumar Hirani is my favourite director. (Dia worked with Hirani in Lage Raho Munnabhai, starring Sanjay Dutt as Munnabhai.) It was an absolute pleasure to be asked by him to be a part of Sanjay Dutt?s biopic. [Hirani] is one of those real people who tells stories in the most unique and honest way. I have known Sanju sir for many years and through the course of my interaction with him, I have interacted with Maanyata as well.

64,"In a ridiculous step, the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) in Patna has asked its employees to declare whether they are virgin. The marriage declaration form which has come to light is applicable for hospital employees and freshly recruited doctors and nursing staffs. The form also asks male employees to provide details if they have more than one wife.Women employees apart from declaring status regarding their virginity have also been asked to provide details on whether she is married to a person who has no other wife living or another wife living. Speaking to India Today, the Deputy Medical Superintendent, Dr Manish Mandal said that the marriage declaration form with the contentious questions have been in practice ever since the institute was established in 1984.""Everyone has to fill this form which is part of Central Services Rules and this form is similar to what AIIMS in Delhi uses. If the Centre or AIIMS changes the format of the form in the future, we will also change it. This is not a new form and has been in practice since 1984 when IGIMS was established"", said Mandal.  Elaborating on the need to extract personal details like one's virginity, Dr Mandal said that the questions have been asked in order to avert any kind of wrong doing. ""In the Central Services Rules there is a provision that when a person joins the service and later on if she dies because of any eventuality, there may be a claimant or boy friend who may come to seek job in place of the victim"", said Dr Mandal . However, Dr Mandal admitted that the use of word virginity was incorrect.""Essentially what is being asked in the form is whether a person is married or unmarried?  Personally I feel the word used should have been unmarried instead of virgin.

68,"Sheikhs from Egypt?s highest Islamic authority have opened a fatwa kiosk in the Cairo metro to offer religious advice to commuters in what they say is an effort to counter extremism.The idea is proving popular with travellers passing through Cairo?s al-Shohada metro station, a busy transport hub, who queue up to sit with a group of religious scholars inside a green patterned booth, sheltered from the bustle of the metro.?We usually talk about the issues of daily life, and what religion says about such things. The topics we mostly discuss are marriage, divorce and inheritance,? said one sheikh staffing the booth for the morning commute, who declined to be named.According to al-Azhar al-Sharif, Egypt?s top Islamic body, which installed the booth, the project is intended to correct misinterpretations of Islam. The institution has frequently clashed with the government of the president, Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi, who has repeatedly called for a ?religious reformation? in Islam to combat extremism.Egypt has grappled with a spike in jihadist activity since Sisi came to power in 2013, including a recent string of large-scale attacks on Coptic Christian sites as well as ongoing violence in the Sinai peninsula.Al-Azhar, established in Cairo in 971 as a centre of Sunni Muslim learning, is hoping that the booth will help steer Egyptians away from extremist thought.Sheikh Tamer Mattar, the coordinator of its International Centre for Electronic Fatwas, said that the booth was designed to direct citizens to seek advice from al-Azhar, instead of extremist groups. ?The experiment was successful so far and we hope that it will expand,? he said. ?We can say it was successful, as in the eight days of the initiative, we received 1,500 questions. At any moment you can find tens of people waiting to present theirs.?The booth operates two shifts daily, welcoming visitors from 9am until 8pm. Yet few seemed convinced that the project would attract those with pre-existing extremist tendencies to seek guidance, especially as those staffing the booth noted down the identity card number of those visiting along with their complaints. Extremists won?t come to us to seek advice,? said the sheikh staffing the booth for its morning shift. ?We?re targeting people on the street who are ignorant of religious matters ? they come to us and we try to put them on the right track of moderation.? Mohamed Abu-Hamed, an Egyptian MP who has sparred frequently with al-Azhar over a desire for greater government regulation of the religious body and its teachings, dismissed the booths. ?The whole project is absurd. It is a superficial understanding of the call to renew the religious rhetoric,? he said.?When we talk about renewing religious rhetoric, we mean the main content [of their teachings],? he said. ?If al-Azhar created these kiosks while thinking that this is renewing religious rhetoric, then they don?t get it. They are doing this to evade making any real changes.? ","Egypt's highest Islamic authority Al-Azhar Al-Sharif has opened a fatwa kiosk at Cairo metro to offer commuters religious advice in an effort to counter extremism.

Though the fines are not particularly hefty ? Rs 10 for delay up to a year and Rs 50 beyond that period ? it is liable to increase over time. ?We took all sections of society into confidence before taking a decision on the issue,? health minister Siddharth Nath Singh told mediapersons later in the day.However, Singh admitted that the cabinet did not concede to demands from a few Muslim clerics who wanted their community exempt from having to furnish photographs of the bride and groom. ?Yes, they made such a demand because the nikahnama (the Islamic marriage contract) does not carry images. But if photographs can be submitted to procure documents such as Aadhaar cards, I don?t see why the same cannot be done for marriage registration,? he said.While the stamps and registration department will double as the nodal agency for marriage registration, the government will launch an online portal to ensure easy access. The Centre had already made marriage registration compulsory across the country, in keeping with a 2006 Supreme Court ruling. Uttar Pradesh was among the only two states that had failed to implement the directive, an anomaly that minister for women welfare and tourism development Rita Bahuguna Joshi had earlier vowed to rectify. ?We will implement the Supreme Court?s order in the state.

85,"If you drive a car in Delhi and its suburbs then bad and crowded roads are burning a big hole in your pocket.An ongoing study on how much fuel is wasted because of potholed roads and bad traffic has found that vehicles travelling on ?average?, crowded roads consumed nearly one-and-a-half time more fuel per kilometre compared to ?good?, fuel-efficient roads. The figure is expected to rise to three times during the next phase of the study to be conducted on inferior road stretches.The study, commissioned in May, released its preliminary findings last week involving a Sports Utility Vehicle with a mileage of 10 -12 km/litre. Subsequent tests will be conducted with small cars and loaded and empty trucks. The findings use a three-tier grading system to assess road conditions. Traffic congestion is also a parameter.The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Central Road Research Institute (CSIR-CRRI) conducted the study. It was found that an SUV consumed about 40.25 millilitres of fuel per kilometre when it travelled on the Noida Expressway, considered a good, fuel-efficient road. The same vehicle consumed about 95.5 millilitres of fuel for every kilometre when travelling from Noida Expressway to Kalindi Kunj and onto Jasola.The consumption was even higher at 137.2 millilitres per km when the vehicle travelled from Botanical Garden to Kailash Hospital in Noida. ?The initial findings of the study conducted on two road stretches in Delhi have revealed that Delhiites could be consuming at least two-to-three times more fuel because of bad quality roads and traffic conditions,? said Ravindra Kumar, principal scientist of CRRI?s transport and planning division.?The result is they end up paying more.?A preliminary estimate puts the wastage across India at Rs 960 crore a day. Although the extra expense incurred by an individual driver might not ring alarm bells, the cumulative wastage would be an added burden on India?s oil imports bill.The initial study was carried out on more than 600 km of the best roads in Delhi and its suburbs such as the Yamuna Expressway, Delhi Gurgaon Expressway and NH24 to collect the baseline data ? the best fuel-efficient roads. ?Now we are driving the same vehicles on various roads of Delhi to find out how much extra fuel they consume,?

89,"Scores of easyJet passengers were stranded on the Greek island of Zakynthos (also known as Zante) after their plane developed technical difficulties and a replacement aircraft was prevented from flying in because of mating turtles. Passengers expressed fury at easyJet?s lack of communication and ?incredibly bad? handling of the delay, which began on Sunday afternoon.  Some travellers, who did not book on to other flights, were only able to make it home on Tuesday.  A fault with a wing flap was announced by the captain soon after passengers boarded the flight to Gatwick at around 3pm on Sunday, and there was no communication for another hour.  Despite being told the problem would be resolved in 20 minutes, passengers were soon asked to disembark.  They were forced to wait through ?hours of nothingness,? according to Rebecca Morris, 39, who was travelling with her husband and two small children.  She described the facilities at Zakynthos airport as ?basic? and said there was no help or guidance from easyJet apart from the odd automated text message.  ?There was no food or refreshments and there was no representative from easyJet,? Morris said.  She said that while her family?s travel agents helped them find accommodation and taxis, other passengers were left to ?fend for themselves?.  A similar process was repeated on Monday.  The airline said the night curfew ? apparently in place because of vulnerable loggerhead turtles breeding nearby ? had prevented an alternative aircraft being sent out.

A spokesman said: ?Unfortunately easyJet was unable to operate flight EZY8746 from Zante to London Gatwick on Sunday 30 July due to a technical fault with the aircraft and had to delay the flight overnight.  ?Engineers were immediately dispatched to Zante and believed that the technical issue was rectified yesterday, however it then reoccurred before boarding which meant the flight could not operate. The safety of our passengers and crew is our highest priority and we will only operate if it is safe to do so.  ?We do all possible to try and minimise delays and as such planned to send a replacement aircraft. Unfortunately, due to the night curfew rule at the airport, we were unable to get the replacement aircraft into the airport.

101,"There is only a 5% chance that the Earth will avoid warming by at least 2C come the end of the century, according to new research that paints a sobering picture of the international effort to stem dangerous climate change.Global trends in the economy, emissions and population growth make it extremely unlikely that the planet will remain below the 2C threshold set out in the Paris climate agreement in 2015, the study states. The Paris accord, signed by 195 countries, commits to holding the average global temperature to ?well below 2C? above pre-industrial levels and sets a more aspirational goal to limit warming to 1.5C. This latter target is barely plausible, the new research finds, with just a 1% chance that temperatures will rise by less than 1.5C. ?We?re closer to the margin than we think,? said Adrian Raftery, a University of Washington academic who led the research, published in Nature Climate Change. ?If we want to avoid 2C, we have very little time left. The public should be very concerned.? Governments settled on the 2C threshold partly through political expediency but also because scientists have warned of severe consequences from sea level rise, drought, heatwaves and social unrest should the temperature rise beyond this.  Such risks have been underscored by a separate study, also released on Monday, that shows unabated climate change will cause around 60,000 deaths globally in 2030 and 260,000 deaths by 2100. The study, by the University of North Carolina, found that rising temperatures will exacerbate air pollutants that will particularly threaten those with existing conditions.  According to the University of Washington study, there is a 90% likelihood that temperatures will rise between 2C and 4.9C by 2100. This would put the world in the mid-range warming scenarios mapped out by the UN?s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It negates the most optimistic outcome as well as the worst case, which would see temperatures climb nearly 6C beyond the pre-industrial era. Rather than look at how greenhouse gases will influence temperature, the new research analyzed the past 50 years of trends in world population, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted for each dollar of economic activity. After building a statistical model covering a range of emissions scenarios, the researchers found that carbon intensity will be a crucial factor in future warming. Technological advances are expected to cut global carbon intensity by 90% over the course of the century, with sharp declines in China and India ? two newly voracious consumers of energy. However, this decline still will not be steep enough to avoid breaching the 2C limit.  The world?s population is expected to grow to about 11 billion people by 2100, but the research found that this will have a relatively small impact upon temperatures as much of this growth will take place in sub-Saharan Africa, which is a minor contributor of greenhouse gas emissions. It has long been acknowledged that emissions cuts promised under the the Paris agreement would not be sufficient to avoid 2C warming. However, it is hoped that periodic reviews of commitments will result in more severe reductions. Donald Trump?s pledge to remove the US, the world?s second-largest emitter, from the accord has cast a large shadow over these ambitions.  ?Even if the 2C target isn?t met, action is very important,? said Raftery. ?The more the temperature increases, the worse the impacts will be. ?We would warn against any tendency to use our results to say that we won?t avoid 2C, and so it?s too late to do anything. On the contrary, avoiding the higher temperature increases that our model envisages is even more important, and also requires urgent action.? Raftery acknowledged that a breakthrough technology could ?dramatically? change the outlook but noted that major advances of the past 50 years, such as the computer, robotics, hybrid cars, the internet and electronic fuel injection, have improved carbon efficiency steadily at around 2% a year, rather than in huge jumps. Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University who was not involved in the study, said the research?s conclusions were ?reasonable? but said it was difficult to assign a precise probability to future temperature rises. ?I agree that staying below 2C and 1.5C are unlikely and very, very unlikely, respectively,? he said. ?But this research gives a false sense of rigor. Tomorrow someone could invent a carbon-free energy source that everyone adopts. ?If you look at technology adoption and action taken on the ozone layer and acid rain, it?s clear these things can change faster than people predict.? Dessler said the falling cost of renewable energy would be a major factor in reducing emissions but further impetus would be needed through new actions such as a price on carbon.  ?It?s like you?re driving and about to collide with the car in front of you,? he said. ?You want to hit the brakes as fast as you can. The later you wait, the more painful it?s going to be.?John Sterman, an academic at the MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative, said the research was an ?urgent call to action?. MIT research has shown that emissions cuts in the Paris agreement would stave off around 1C of temperature increase by 2100 ? findings misrepresented by Trump when he announced the US departure from the pact.Sterman said the US must ?dramatically speed the deployment of renewable energy and especially energy efficiency. Fortunately, renewables, storage and other technologies are already cheaper than fossil energy in many places and costs are falling fast.?More aggressive policies are urgently needed, but this study should not be taken as evidence that nothing can be done.?","According to a recently published US-based research, there is only a 5% chance that Earth will avoid warming by at least 2°C by 2100, the threshold set in the Paris climate agreement. The research studied global trends in the economy, emissions and population growth, and further stated that there is 1% chance that temperatures will rise by less than 1.5°C.",
102,"After a swarm of bees held up a Hyderabad-Pune flight last week for more than one hour, the country aviation regulator said it will investigate how a bee hive was allowed to flourish in the airport area. The flight on July 26 was held up when the ATR?72 - a short-haul aircraft - was besieged by bees. The flight, which was scheduled to take off at around 6.25pm, took off only at around 7.22pm after a repellent spray was used to clear the insects from the apron area. This was the first such incident in the past five years.  A Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) official on Monday said, ?We will look into the matter and necessary action will be taken.? Air India spokesperson, Dhananjay Kumar, confirmed the incident and said that taking safety as priority, the pilot took necessary precautions before taking off the flight. ?The swarms of bees kept coming and settling on the wind screen of the cockpit, not allowing the pilot to push back,? he explained.The incident took place when the flight was to line up for its scheduled take off. The Flight 9I 867 of Alliance Air, a subsidiary of Air India, couldn?t push back when a group of bees surrounded the twin engine turboprop. Though the aircraft?s door was shut to stop bees from entering it, the pilot got in touch with the Air Traffic Control (ATC) who in turn informed the airport operator. The pilot had to then call for a spray in order to get rid of the bees. Commenting on the incident, Captain Mohan Ranganathan, aviation safety expert, said, ?Bees do not pose a threat to the ATR but the engineers and other ground staff who play a major role before take-off would  have found it impossible to perform their functions due to their presence.? Pilots said that the bee hives shouldn?t be in the airport premises as part of the air safety measures taken in the airport. Former Indian Air Force helicopter pilot and aviation expert, Vipul Saxena, said that the delay will not only be with respect to the safety of the passengers but also for the safety of the cockpit crew.?The DGCA should take a note of the incident and ensure that they do not occur again,? said a senior pilot associated with a leading airline. ","A swarm of bees reportedly attacked a Hyderabad-Pune flight last week and delayed it by almost an hour.

As per the 2011 census, the Christian population in Jharkhand rose by a whopping 29.7% in the last 10 years followed by that of Muslims 28.4%, while Hindu population rose by 21%.To begin with, the government curbed the flow of government funds to various Christian affiliate social organisations and development groups that were allegedly misusing government money to convert people.Chief minister Das has voiced his concerns over the conversion of tribals through force or allurement on several occasions, and asked gullible tribals to protect their culture and religious practices at any cost.?Those indulging in forcible religious conversion would not be spared,? Das had said at a couple of public meetings in Gumla and Khunti, urging tribals not to fall prey to the baits of Christian missionary organisations.Christian and pro-Christian tribal groups had then raised objections over the CM?s remarks. Senior IAS officer Vandana Dadel, a tribal and practicing Catholic, shared her anguish on Facebook over the government?s over-indulgence in checking religious conversions, which, she said, is an individual?s choice and hence, should be left to the people.Christian groups have again upped their ante, this time, against the proposed legislation.?The BJP government?s intentions are not good. It wants to divide the tribals to further their political agenda in preparations for the next election,? said Prem Chand Murmu, president of Adivasi Budhijivi Manch (ABM).?Conversion is an individual choice. When one converts, his religion changes, not his caste. Reservation is given on basis of caste, not religion. But the BJP government is relating conversion to caste, which is not fair. We will protest the legislation,? he said.Murmu on Monday called on the National ST Commission and drew its attention towards the alleged violation of democratic rights of tribals in the state.Opposition Congress and JMM too criticised the proposed legislation. ?BJP wants to impose the RSS ideology on tribals and further their divide and rule agenda in the state,? said state Congress secretary, Aditya Vikram Jaiswal.JMM spokesperson Supriyo Bhattacharya said the legislation is aimed at creating friction among the tribal society, which does not augur well for the secular fabric of the nation. ?We will oppose the legislation tooth and nail,? he said.","The Jharkhand government on Tuesday cleared a draft anti-conversion bill which aims to ban religious conversion through force or allurement.

""No one should expect us to swallow the bitter fruit that is harmful to our sovereignty, security or development interests,"" Xi said as the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) is engaged in a standoff with Indian troops at Doklam in the Sikkim section since mid-June. Though there was no direct reference to the Sikkim standoff, Xi urged the PLA to focus on war preparedness to forge an elite and powerful force that is always ""ready for the fight, capable of combat and sure to win"". ""There are various means and choices to safeguard peace and security and prevent war, but military means should remain the final guarantee,"" he said.  Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks at the ceremony to mark the 90th founding anniversary of the 2.3 million strong PLA, the worlds largest standing army. He said China would never allow ""any people, organisation or political party to split any part of Chinese territory out of the country at any time, in any form."" ""The Chinese people love peace. We will never seek aggression or expansion, but we have the confidence to defeat all invasions,"" Xi, 64, said at the ceremony held at the Great Hall of the People attended by Premier Li Keqiang and other top leaders of the ruling Communist Party and army officials.

The recovered weapons are engraved with ?Made in England? and ?Made in USA? markings.A mother of five children, she earlier worked as a labourer in the fields but her income was not sufficient to meet her basic needs. Being unable to make her ends meet, she came in contact with arms traffickers in MP and started supplying illegal arms. ?It had come to notice that arms manufacturers and suppliers from MP are supplying sophisticated firearms in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas of UP. A team was deputed to identify the gang in Delhi. The team deployed informers in and around Delhi-NCR, MP and UP to gather leads about the gang and the racket,? DCP special cell, PS Kushwah said.Police recovered 14 semi-automatic sophisticated pistols of 7.65mm with 14 magazines from Mobai?s possession.?Last Wednesday, we received an information that one woman supplier of illegal arms, who is also a proclaimed offender, would come near Shastri Park, between 6pm and 7pm to deliver a huge cache of semi-automatic weapons and meet her contacts,?

116,"Serena Williams, one of the highest paid and most successful athletes in the world, has issued a stirring call for black women to demand equal pay and spoken about the racism she has faced ?on and off the tennis court?.In a personal essay published by Fortune to coincide with Black Women?s Equal Pay Day, the tennis superstar said the gender pay gap ?hits women of colour the hardest?, as they suffer from both gender and racial financial disparity. For every dollar earned by men in the US, Williams said, black women earn 63 cents, and 17% less than white women.Her comments come as pay gaps are examined in a range of industries after the BBC was engulfed in scandal when it published a list of its top earners in July.Williams, a 23-times grand slam winner, wrote that black women have to work eight months longer to earn the same ?as their male counterparts do in one year?, and drew on her own experiences to highlight the unfair treatment of black women in the workplace. ?I?ve been disrespected by my male colleagues and ? in the most painful times ? I?ve been the subject of racist remarks on and off the tennis court,? she wrote.Williams has repeatedly been the target of sexist and racist remarks by men in tennis. In 2016 the chief executive of the Indian Wells tennis tournament, Raymond Moore, said women?s tennis was riding on the coat-tails of the men?s tour and that female players should ?thank god? for Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. In April the Romanian team captain, Ilie Nastase, made an apparently racist comment about Williams?s unborn baby and was heard calling her and Johanna Konta ?fucking bitches?. Most recently, former champion John McEnroe said Williams would ?be, like, 700 in the world? if she played on the men?s tour. ?Luckily I am blessed with an inner drive and a support system of family and friends that encourage me to move forward. But these injustices still hurt,? Williams wrote.July 31 is Black Women's Equal Pay Day. Black women are the cornerstone of our communities, they are phenomenal, and they deserve equal pay. pic.twitter.com/XOHyIdbYPcNoting that she is ?in the rare position to be financially successful beyond my imagination?, Williams said that, if she had not been lucky enough to pick up a tennis racquet and break through, she would be like the other 24 million black women facing wage disparities in the US.?The cycles of poverty, discrimination and sexism are much, much harder to break than the record for Grand Slam titles,? she wrote. ?For every black woman that rises through the ranks to a position of power, there are too many others who are still struggling.?She said that changing the status quo would take courage to push the issue into the spotlight and force employers to compensate female employees equally: ?We deserve equal pay for our mothers, our wives, our daughters, our nieces, friends, and colleagues ? but mostly for ourselves.?Black women: be fearless. Speak out for equal pay. Every time you do, you?re making it a little easier for a woman behind you. Let?s get back those 37 cents.?Black Women?s Equal Pay Day, on 31 July, marked how long into 2017 an African American woman would have to work to be paid the same wages as her white male counterpart last year. ?Despite the large gender disadvantage faced by all women, black women were near parity with white women in 1979,? the Economic Policy Institute said. ?However in 2016, white women?s wages grew to 76% of white men?s, compared to 67% for black women relative to white men ? a racial difference of nine percentage points. The trend is going the wrong way ? progress is slowing for black women.?In the UK, research by the Fawcett Society in March revealed a similar story, that many minority ethnic women were ?left behind? by progress on the pay gap. Black African women in the UK have seen virtually no progress since the 1990s in closing the gender pay gap with white British men, with a full-time pay gap of 21.4% in the 1990s and 19.6% today. ?Black African women have been largely left behind, and in terms of closing the pay gap, Pakistani and Bangladeshi women are today only where white British women were in the 1990s,? Sam Smethers, the charity?s chief executive, said.The low number of staff from ethnic minorities on the BBC?s list of its best-paid talent has also provoked an angry response inside the corporation, after no black or ethnic minority staff featured among those earning the top 24 salaries. Williams has been a consistent advocate of equal pay. Earlier this month, when asked about what she would want for her child, she said: ?If my daughter were to play in a sport and she was able to have equal prize money, or equal pay, or equal rights, I feel like that would be a success. And if not, I would really want her to speak up for it. Any daughter of mine will have a voice.?She also praised Andy Murray after he corrected a journalist who said Sam Querrey was ?the first US player to reach a major semi-final since 2009?. Williams has joined the board of Silicon Valley firm SurveyMonkey to help tech companies diversify their workforces.","Tennis star Serena Williams wrote a personal essay in which she demanded equal pay for black women. In the essay, Williams said that for every dollar earned by men in the United States, black women earn just 63 cents. ""The cycles of poverty, discrimination and sexism are much, much harder to break than the Grand Slam titles record,"" Williams wrote.",

Shepard had written 44 plays including Buried Child, which won him the Pulitzer prize for drama in 1979. He also received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor for his role in The Right Stuff.Shepard started writing plays in the 60s. ?Back then, there was a dearth of American theatre,? he told the Observer in 2014. ?There was nothing going on. American art was starving.?His work included Angel City, Cowboy Mouth (in collaboration with Patti Smith that was written in just two nights) and a screenplay for Wim Wenders? Paris, Texas. He received Tony nominations for both Buried Child and a 2000 revival of True West.Shepard also directed many of his plays but with rare exceptions, he refrained from directing work of others. He directed two films: 1988?s Far North with then-partner Jessica Lange and 1993?s Silent Tongue, which starred Richard Harris and River Phoenix.He also collaborated with Bob Dylan for the song Brownsville Girl which featured on his 1986 album Knocked Out Loaded. As an actor, his first notable role was in Terrence Malick?s Days of Heaven in 1978. He went on to star in Baby Boom, Steel Magnolias, The Pelican Brief, Black Hawk Down, The Notebook and August: Osage County. He was most recently seen in the Netflix drama Bloodline, alongside Sissy Spacek.He was known as an acclaimed character actor rather than an A-lister, a route he chose early in his career. ?I had all kinds of wild offers at that time to be a movie star and I panicked,? he later said. ?I was turning down things like Warren Beatty?s Reds, that part of Eugene O?Neill [played by Jack Nicholson]. My agent was going crazy. I hadn?t realized what the experience of it would be like ? to be on the verge of being a movie star. Because it?s like you are the hottest whore in town. Everybody wants you.?When asked about his performances on stage, he said he wasn?t quite as comfortable as on screen. ?You don?t have to do anything in the movies,? he said in an interview with the New York Times. ?You just sit there. Well, that?s not entirely true. You do less. I find the whole situation of confronting an audience terrifying.?Before his death, he completed a role in the psychological thriller Never Here with Mireille Enos. This year also saw the release of his book The One Inside, a series of conversations with himself. He is survived by three children.Figures from both stage and screen have paid tribute to Shepard on Twitter. Writer Beau Willimon referred to him as ?fearless? and ?one of the greats?, Harlan Coben tweeted: ?How special was he? Even when you didn?t like something he?d done, you were glad you saw it? and Reese Witherspoon called him ?a truly original actor and an incredible writer?.","Playwright-actor Sam Shepard, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1979 for his play 'Buried Child', passed away at the age of 73.

Senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar demanded a probe into the allegations made by a woman from Sangli district against the minister, who is not from BJP, but from one of the party?s smaller allies. In the state assembly, Pawar claimed he had a CD to prove the allegations.  The Opposition staged a walkout from the lower house, even after Speaker Haribhau Bagade ordered a probe into the allegations.Meanwhile, Fadnavis clarified that the victim withdrew her complaint the very next day saying it was filed owing to a misunderstanding. ?In her video statement before the police, she said the complaint filed a day before was out of misunderstanding. She had a dispute with a person named Prashant Jadhav and was under the impression that the minister was helping Jadhav against her.

126,"A day after Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar accused long-time ally Lalu Prasad of being smothered in corruption, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief hit back on Tuesday, asserting that his ?friend-turned-foe? was a ?turncoat? and he (Nitish Kumar) is known for his dubious character.Speaking at a press conference in Patna, Lalu Prasad said, ?I know Nitish Kumar from the beginning as I?m senior to him. He is one big ?palturam? (turncoat) whose true colours will soon show. From the very beginning, he is known for his dubious character. Nitish has forgotten the days when he used to take my blessing and go for any political debate or talks?.Further lashing out at Nitish Kumar, Lalu Prasad said that only because of Mulayam Singh, he allowed the chief minister in his alliance.?Yesterday (Monday) when he accused me and my family; I knew it was coming. As he is not a man of his words. He has also forgotten the day when I made him rule the state and join my alliance with open arms. It was only because of Mulayam Singh that I agreed to accept him in my party. But today I regret of the time spent and the moment lost,? he said.Taking a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Lalu Prasad said Nitish Kumar used to speak ill of the BJP and today, he is singing the party?s glory.?Till yesterday, Nitish was accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Now suddenly he is singing his praises and calling him the biggest leader in the country. This comes as a shock to me! He also added that there is no one who can defeat him.

The victim was allegedly stabbed by one of the three young men, who then jumped out of the moving train.?I asked the three men to deboard the train as they did not have tickets. They had boarded a reserved coach of the train. Instead, they asked me not to bother and also hurled abuses when I tried to be stern in asking them to deboard. They looked like locals and were aged 18-22 years. However, one of them hit me with a sharp-edged weapon,? Boro said.?Initially, I did not realise that I was injured.

129,"Police resorted to lathicharge as nearly 500 protesters, gathered at the newly constructed Haj House in Ghaziabad, turned violent and pelted stones at the cops.   The protesters, led by members of the district Congress committee, on Monday gathered outside the Ala Hazrat Haj House in the city and demanded opening it for Haj pilgrims immediately. The facility was inaugurated by former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav last September but has remained locked ever since.Members of the Muslim community also offered namaz outside the locked facility and demanded its proper utilisation as the annual Haj pilgrimage nears.Police said there were around 400 to 500 protestors at the gate who, around 9:30pm, started pelting stones at police personnel deployed in view of the agitation. The protesters also blocked traffic on GT Road, resulting in heavy snarls from?Mohan Nagar to Ghaziabad city. Police have picked up ?four to five persons who were the brain behind the entire protest?. Heavy contingent of police and PCR vans were deployed at the site and also in the sensitive areas of Ghaziabad city.?We demand that the Haj House be opened immediately as it has been locked by the district administration. The Haj House was developed to facilitate the pilgrims. The facility is fully developed, but no one can use it and the pilgrims have to go to Delhi to move ahead for their pilgrimage,? said Naseem Khan, district president of minority cell, Ghaziabad.?It is sheer negligence that Haj pilgrims cannot use a facility developed for their use. We feel that the present government is biased and is acting against the sentiments of the community. We will stay here till the Haj House is opened for the pilgrims,? said Puja Chadda, a local Congress member.Following the demonstration, the city police posted a contingent at the site.?Our personnel are posted at the spot, keeping a close watch over the developments. We told the protesters that the facility has not been locked by the district administration and they have no role in opening or closing it,? said Akash Tomar, superintendent of police (city).An appeal against the 4.3-acre complex, built along the river Hindon, is pending with the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The petitioners, all Ghaziabad residents, had contended that the Haj House had come up on river land and should be demolished.The tribunal had on September 2, 2016 said in its order, ?We make it clear that any steps or construction taken in the meanwhile shall be subject to the orders of the Tribunal passed in this Application (sic).?Earlier, on July 27, HT had published a report on the facility lying non-functional. In the report, UP minister of state for Waqf, Mohsin Raza, had said that the decision was taken by the previous state government and the present government has maintained the status quo.?The decision was already made by the previous government as the matter was with the NGT even before the present government assumed office. The decision was taken to protect the environment and the river?s ecology. If thousands of pilgrims arrive here it is bound to create garbage issues for the river zone. So, the closure was an earlier decision taken up to avoid contempt of court,? Raza had said.","Nearly 500 protestors pelted stones at the police outside Ghaziabad's Ala Hazrat Haj House and demanded that the facility be opened to pilgrims immediately.

130,"The Canadian government is investigating reports that Saudi Arabia is using armoured vehicles made in Canada against its own civilians ? allegations that have prompted renewed scrutiny over Ottawa?s recent decision to sign off on a billion-dollar arms deal with the kingdom.Videos and photos posted on social media in recent days allegedly show Riyadh using Canadian equipment in a violent crackdown on minority Shia dissidents in eastern Saudi Arabia. Last week at least five people were killed as security forces flushed out suspected militants in the town of Awamiya. Several sources told the Canadian newspaper the Globe and Mail that the vehicles being used appeared to be Gurkha RPVs made in Ontario by Terradyne Armoured Vehicles. Canadian officials said they were deeply concerned by the reports. ?We are looking at these claims very seriously ? and have immediately launched a review,? Justin Trudeau told reporters. In 2016, Saudi Arabia ranked among the largest importers of Canada-made military goods, purchasing more than C$142m worth of goods ? nearly 20% of all Canadian military exports that year.The ministry of global affairs said it was concerned over the escalating violence in eastern Saudi Arabia. In a statement issued last week, it highlighted the causalities among civilians and security forces and urged Riyadh to confront its security challenges in ?a manner that abides by international human rights law?.Days later, the ministry said the government was actively seeking more information about the reports of civilian casualties and claims that Canadian-made vehicles were involved. ?If it is found that Canadian exports have been used to commit serious violations of human rights, the minister will take action,? a spokesperson for department told the Guardian. He did not answer questions around what kinds of actions this could entail. Terradyne Armoured Vehicles did not respond to a request for comment. The allegations have prompted renewed calls for Trudeau?s Liberal government to scrap a recent decision to push forward with a 15-year contract to supply Saudi Arabia with weaponised armoured vehicles made by General Dynamics, another Ontario-based company. Critics say the C$15bn deal, struck in 2014 by the previous conservative government, could see the vehicles ? which are equipped with machine guns ? used by the Saudis to crush dissent at home. Others have pointed to Canadian rules that restrict arms exports to countries with poor human rights records and prohibit exports if there is a possibility that the buyer could use the arms against its own population. Despite these concerns, Trudeau?s Liberal government signed off on the export permits in 2016. Trudeau has since defended the decision, arguing that Canada would be seen as a ?banana republic? if it scrapped the deal. ?People have to know that when you sign a deal with Canada, a change in governments won?t immediately scrap the jobs and benefits coming from it,? the prime minister told the Toronto Star last year. The deal would reportedly create around 3,000 jobs in Canada. Amid escalating concerns over human rights, countries such as Germany and Belgium have in recent years denied export applications for arms headed to Saudi Arabia. In 2015, Sweden cancelled a longstanding defence agreement with the Saudis, citing similar concerns. This month, a high court in London ruled that the UK could proceed with arms sales to Saudi Arabia. ?Saudi Arabia has been, and remains, genuinely committed to compliance with International Humanitarian Law; and there was no ?real risk? that there might be ?serious violations? of International Humanitarian Law (in its various manifestations) such that UK arm sales to Saudi Arabia should be suspended or cancelled,? the court said. Campaigners called the ruling a ?green light? for the UK to sell arms to ?brutal dictatorships and human rights abusers?.In Canada, Amnesty International pointed to the indications that Canadian vehicles are being used against civilians to call on the Liberal government to reverse its support of the billion-dollar arms deal.?Mounting tensions and conflict in eastern Saudi Arabia, about which the Canadian government has rightly expressed public concern, further indicate how fraught it is for Canada to have authorised the sale of light armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia at this time,? secretary-general Alex Neve said in a statement. ","Canada is investigating reports that Saudi Arabia has been using Canadian-made armoured vehicles against its citizens in the violence-hit Eastern Province. Videos and photos posted on social media show Saudi Arabia using Canadian equipment on Shia dissidents. Canada warned it would take action if ""it is found that Canadian exports have been used to commit serious violations of human rights"".",

134,"China is constructing a 12-km-long high-speed train tunnel through one of the portions of its iconic Great Wall to connect Zhangjiakou city which is due to co-host 2022 winter Olympics along with Beijing.It took the Chinese engineers months to choreograph the best intersection point. In the end, the tunnel, deep below the Badaling section of the Great Wall, passed experts? appraisal, state-run People?s Daily reported.The line is designed for trains travelling up to 350km per hour, which is expected to shorten the single-journey time from more than 3 hours to approximately one hour. The line is estimated to be completed in 2019.The depth of the tunnel will range from four metres to 432 metres. Now, people are holding their breath on the completion of the tunnel while ensuring that the Great Wall is not damaged in the process, the Global Times reported.Luo Duhao, chief engineer of the Beijing-Zhangjiakou High-Speed Railway Line, being built by China Railway Number 5 Engineering Group Co said the firm will employ ?precision micro-blasting? technology, which has a velocity of 0.2 cm per second and is able to make the tremor weaker than the traditional firepower blasts that have a velocity of 5 cm per second.Luo told the Global Times that the new technology will ensure that the Great Wall will not be affected by the blasts, as they will be barely felt.?The new technology causes little damage to the geological environment, which will help protect the Great Wall,? Dai Longzhen, deputy manager of the Beijing-Zhangjiakou High-Speed Railway Line, told the Global Times.?I myself once stood on the Great Wall and I could not feel the blast at all,? Dai added.Zhang Xuehua, a blast expert at the construction site, told the People?s Daily that the construction of the tunnel has completed 4,500 blasts since early February this year.In the middle of the tunnel, workers will build a spacious and well-decorated station right under the Great Wall, with a record-breaking construction space of 36,000 square metres, the Xinhua News Agency reported.The station will be 102 metres below the surface of the Badaling Great Wall.Dai said the construction area and the depth of the station is ?record-breaking.?He said that because the station is built underground, it will cause less damage to the plantation, and it also demonstrates China?s top-notch railway construction capabilities.Originating from the Beijing Railway Station North, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou High-Speed Railway Line runs through Haidian, Changping and Yanqing districts of Beijing.

135,"Donald Trump personally dictated the press statement issued in the name of his eldest son Donald Jr that misleadingly downplayed the significance of a 2016 meeting with a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer, a new report alleged on Monday night.According to the Washington Post, Trump personally intervened to prevent senior White House advisers from issuing a full and truthful account of the meeting on 9 June 2016 in which Donald Trump Jr, the president?s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and then presidential campaign manager Paul Manafort came face-to-face with four Russians. One of the Russian visitors was the well-connected lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.The report, based on multiple though largely anonymous sources that included the president?s own advisers, has the potential to cause political, and even legal, trouble for the White House because it draws Trump himself much closer into the fray over the Trump Tower meeting, which has become a lightning rod in the Russian affair.Shunning the guidance of lawyers and overturning the view apparently reached by Kushner and his team of advisers that a full and frank accounting should be made, Trump reportedly dictated a statement on board Air Force One as he was flying back to Washington from the G20 summit in Germany. As would soon become apparent, it gave a very partial and distorted account of events.In the release the 2016 meeting was presented, in Trump?s own words, as ?a short introductory meeting? dominated by discussion of the adoption of Russian children that was ?not a campaign issue at the time?.That statement was presented to the New York Times on 8 July, and duly included in the newspaper?s first account of the meeting. But within 24 hours, highly damaging revelations had emerged that made clear the meeting had been much more charged than that.On 9 July, the Times revealed that Trump Jr had been lured into talking to Veselnitskaya by the promise of negative intelligence on his father?s presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, and two days after that the email chain was published that showed the younger Trump reveling in the idea of receiving dirt on the Democratic presidential candidate, uttering the gleeful phrase: ?I love it?.The Trump Tower meeting has proved to be one of the most toxic pieces of information to emerge so far in the billowing investigation into possible ties between Trump associates and Russia in the Kremlin?s efforts to skew the presidential outcome in favor of the Republican nominee. The special counsel leading the investigation, Robert Mueller, is understood to be looking closely at the event and has reportedly asked the White House to preserve all documents relating to it.Until now, the president managed to keep some distance from the 9 June encounter, with his lawyers claiming that he knew nothing about it. But the new report that Trump personally oversaw the issuing of a misleading account of the proceedings raises questions about the president?s role in what could be conceived as a cover-up.It comes as Mueller has already expanded his inquiry to include the issue of whether Trump was engaging in a possible obstruction of justice when he fired James Comey, having tried and failed to persuade the then director of the FBI to back off investigating former national security adviser Michael Flynn?s contacts with Russian officials.A lawyer for the president issued the Washington Post with a curt statement: ?Apart from being of no consequence, the characterizations are misinformed, inaccurate, and not pertinent,? Jay Sekulow said.The new details of the president?s role in what turned out to be a major communications fiasco come on the day that his current communications chief, Anthony Scaramucci, was dismissed from the White House after barely 11 days. The blunt removal was made on the first day of the new White House chief of staff, John Kelly, who has vowed to introduce the kind of discipline that the West Wing has been sorely lacking.The day began shortly before 5.30am with Trump tweeting ?No WH chaos!? and ended with him saying: ?A great day at the White House?. But as the Washington Post?s forensic deconstruction of the framing of the Trump Tower meeting shows, the president himself has the capacity to destroy even the best-laid plans, underlining the task now facing his new chief of staff.According to the Post, senior White House officials together with the circle around Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, had spent days rehearsing various ways to address the Trump Tower meeting publicly.Kushner?s team was reported to have decided that it was better to ?err on the side of transparency? because the whole truth would eventually come out.Trump, however, appeared to have seen things differently.","US President Donald Trump personally dictated a misleading statement which his son Donald Trump Jr delivered on his meeting with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 presidential election campaign, according to a Washington Post report.

Here?s a final submission from someone who used to work as a residential tutor, who contacted Guardian Australia anonymously to share their story:I was working in one of the residential colleges as a member of the staff, and was supporting a student through a case of sexual assault. It was escalated to the university and an internal investigation was conducted (I was not involved in the investigation, but sat in during the interviews). Basically, it was a case of the student?s word against the perpetrator?s and therefore the university concluded that there was not enough evidence to take any action. Based on our experience and from the testimonies given by both sides, my colleagues at the college who were involved in supporting the student and I knew that the victim?s account is more likely to be true than not, but we could not do anything without proof. And because the report came back without any conclusive result, we could not take any official action against the perpetrator. It was frustrating and I felt that we had truly let the victim down.

?The universities often actually make it worse?Here?s a video from Fair Agenda featuring speakers from End Rape on Campus, Hunting Ground Australia and student councils. They speak a bit more about how university processes let students down, either by acting too slowly or not at all. As we?ve seen in the report, there are a number of barriers that contribute to the ?damning statistic? that only 4% of students believe their universities are doing enough.Updated

Here?s some more on methodology. The End Rape On Campus ambassador, Nina Funnell, has criticised the final report for scaling back its own sample size from an earlier census-esque proposal.The original survey was planned for all 1.3 million Australian university students but was reduced and only sent to 300,000, according to Funnell. Of those 300,000, only 31,000 answered. ?Perhaps the response rate would have been higher had the AHRC not trusted universities to select when to send the survey out,? she said.?Left to their own devices many of the universities sent the survey out during student exams when students have more pressing concerns.?Updated

?In a lecture theatre of 100 students, two have been sexually assaulted.?Here?s the sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, talking through the report?s findings this morning.She said one in five students had been sexually harassed in a university setting last year, with women twice as likely as men to be sexually harassed and three times as likely to be sexually assaulted.It?s also worth noting that Jenkin?s hypothetical lecture theatre example only counts on-campus incidents of assault. If we count all incidents, that number rises to seven students out of 100, and one in 10 for female students.Updated

Today?s report has been criticised by some advocates for implying that universities only have an obligation to deal with incidents that happen in a university setting ? either on campus or at a university event. But the co-women?s officer at the University of Sydney, Imogen Grant, told Guardian Australia today that assaults that occur outside of university grounds can still be reported to universities because they involve student perpetrators.She says we should keep in mind that student offenders can be disciplined by their university: Most incidents of assault occur around the broader university community, in share houses and at social events.But the perpetrators are still fellow students. And if the perpetrator is a fellow student, you can report that to the university and you can expect disciplinary action as well.It?s also an issue raised by End Rape On Campus ambassador Nina Funnell, who said in today?s media conference that the report?s 10-point plan had no recommendations for improving disciplinary proceedings against offenders. In response, the chair of Universities Australia, Prof Margaret Gardner, said she had ?begun a conversation? with universities about new misconduct proceedings. Here?s a submission from the report itself that claims this issue has been overlooked:A woman who was sexually assaulted on numerous occasions by her intimate partner, a fellow university student, was told the university had ?no power to do anything, because none of it occurred on-campus?.She felt that the university should have taken action, because she was aware of the perpetrator sexually assaulting at least two other women at her university.

Calla WahlquistAt some point in the pub crawl, usually on the walk between pubs two and three, one of the guys at the front of the group would tip their head back and start singing: ?I wish all the women.?It?s a classic rhyming song, where the lead singer makes observations like, ?I wish all the women/were waves in the ocean/and if I was a surfer/I?d ride them with my motion,? and everybody else sings it back. By the train ride home even the most devoted singers would have run out of verses and switched to ?Beastiality is best?. The hook is everybody chanting: ?Beastiality is best, boys, beastiality is best. Fuck a wallaby!?My two years living at a residential college at an Australian university were some 10 years ago now, so I can only remember what we were supposed to do to an owl.Details about the culture of sexual harassment and prevalence sexual assault at residential colleges contained in the AHRC report were appalling, but they did not surprise me. That?s just O-week. We had a golden bed springs award. I liked living at college. I was new to the city and did not know anyone and at college I had ready-made friends, some of whom remain close friends now. It?s only later that you think about what happened and realise it?s not normal. The Eagle Rock thing? We did that. There was a weekly newsletter about who had slept with who. Everyone told rape jokes. We drank so much we couldn?t move. People who did not join in were ostracised. I remember one occasion where a woman from another hall said she had been raped from a male from our hall. The universal judgment was that she was a slut, she was just making it up. Women did that all the time, didn?t they?Updated

As mentioned earlier today, only 9% of students who had been sexually assaulted on their campus reported the attack to their university. Here are some examples, in survivors? own words, of why they decided not to pursue the perpetrators of their assault or harassment. Multiple submissions said they were deterred by their university?s failure to provide anonymous reporting:Our cohort for our course is incredibly small. I felt too scared to report these incidents. I couldn?t have action taken against him because everyone would find out.Another student had their identity disclosed to their rapist?s friends: The university broke confidentiality by informing organisers of the camp (i.e: the rapist?s friends) what I?d done. People spread lies about me and I was ostracised from the club.Another said the university forced them into a process of face-to-face ?mediation? with their harasser:When I complained to the head of school I had a ?mediation? session with the professor who was harassing me ... he stormed out and slammed the door. He wasn?t told to change his behaviour, the ?mediation session? was all that was done.For many respondents there was always an underlying social pressure not to report, stemming from a fear of being ridiculed, ostracised or shamed for not doing enough. Said one: It was my word against his. He?s known as being a really nice friendly guy so I didn?t think a lot of people would believe me or care.Updated

Residential colleges at Australian universities are full of students from regional and remote areas, as well as international students, many of whom are living away from home for the first time. They?re usually co-ed.They?re also one of the highest risk places on campus for sexual assault and sexual harassment, according to the AHRC survey. Twelve per cent of women and 3% of men who were sexually assaulted at a university in 2015 and 2016 said it had occurred at a residential college.The report found that hazing practices at colleges often involved excessive alcohol consumption and humiliating or degrading acts, ?and, in many cases, sexual harassment and sexual assault?.According to one submission:The aim is to get the freshers as drunk as possible. Maybe a secondary aim is to make them look as ridiculous and embarrassing as possible, giving them costumes, props, and even sometimes smearing food all over them.Said another:You had to participate, there was nothing you could do about it. The administration knew about this and they condoned this. The students had no power whatsoever, you couldn?t say anything. Hazing practices described in the report included getting female students to ?run the gauntlet?, which meant running down a hallway where male students stood in every doorway with the nozzle of a cask of wine sticking out their fly. Female students were required to kneel before each male resident and ?drink from his sack?.Another college had a ritual where all first-year female students had to remove their top when a certain song was played. They would be surrounded by male students and unable to leave the dance floor with their top still on. Other submissions described year-round traditions that focused on residents? sexual exploits.Conquests of guys getting girls from other colleges were broadcasted weekly in this gossip session the whole college had, where you would submit your experiences to an executive, and on weeknights we would gather and hear about everyone?s conquests that week ... women were described as objects or trophies. The report also found that power relationships between resident advisers ? usually senior students ? and first-year students, as well as the close proximity created by living in residential colleges and the easy access to both alcohol and bedrooms, were contributing factors in the high rates of sexual assault.

A nostalgic Shaikh said a typical breakfast back home in Gujarat consisted of ?bhakhri? and ?thepla?. Lunch normally consisted of dal, roti and a dry vegetable dish.However, breakfast at ?Eagleton - The Golf Village?, some 40km outside the state capital Bengaluru, typically comprised idli and dosa while the menu for lunch mostly included rice or ragi balls.?In Gujarat, we are not used to consuming much rice.

Patel needs the support of 45 MLAs to be re-elected and the Congress is doing everything it can to keep its flock together.On Saturday, the Congress moved the chief election commissioner, accusing the BJP government of Gujarat of using ?money, muscle power and government machinery? to engineer defections.

142,"Qatar filed a wide-ranging legal complaint at the World Trade Organization on Monday to challenge a trade boycott by Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and United Arab Emirates, the director of Qatar?s WTO office Ali Alwaleed al-Thani told Reuters.By formally ?requesting consultations? with the three countries, the first step in a trade dispute, Qatar triggered a 60 day deadline for them to settle the complaint or face litigation at the WTO and potential retaliatory trade sanctions.?We?ve given sufficient time to hear the legal explanations on how these measures are in compliance with their commitments, to no satisfactory result,? al-Thani said.?We have always called for dialogue, for negotiations, and this is part of our strategy to talk to the members concerned and to gain more information on these measures, the legality of these measures, and to find a solution to resolve the dispute.?The boycotting states cut ties with Qatar - a major global gas supplier and host to the biggest US military base in the Middle East - on June 5, accusing it of financing militant groups in Syria, and allying with Iran, their regional foe, allegations Doha denies.The boycotting countries have previously told the WTO that they would cite national security to justify their actions against Qatar, using a controversial and almost unprecedented exemption allowed under the WTO rules.They said on Sunday they were ready for talks to tackle the dispute, the worst rift between Gulf Arab states in years, if Doha showed willingness to deal with their demands.The text of Qatar?s WTO complaint cites ?coercive attempts at economic isolation? and spells out how they are impeding Qatar?s rights in the trade in goods, trade in services and intellectual property.The complaints against Saudi Arabia and the UAE run to eight pages each, while the document on Bahrain is six pages.There was no immediate reaction from the three to Qatar?s complaint, which is likely to be circulated at the WTO later this week.?REMAIN HOPEFUL?The disputed trade restrictions include bans on trade through Qatar?s ports and travel by Qatari citizens, blockages of Qatari digital services and websites, closure of maritime borders and prohibition of flights operated by Qatari aircraft.The complaint does not put a value on the trade boycott, and al-Thani declined to estimate how much Qatar could seek in sanctions if the litigation ever reached that stage, which can take 2-5 years or longer in the WTO system.?We remain hopeful that the consultations could bear fruit in resolving this,? he said.The WTO suit does not include Egypt, the fourth country involved in the boycott. Although it has also cut travel and diplomatic ties with Qatar, Egypt did not expel Qatari citizens or ask Egyptians to leave Qatar.Al-Thani declined to explain why Egypt was not included.?Obviously all options are available. But we have not raised a consultation request with Egypt yet,? he said.In its WTO case, Qatar would also draw attention to the impact the boycott was having on other WTO members, he added.Many trade diplomats say that using national security as a defence risks weakening the WTO by removing a taboo that could enable countries to escape international trade obligations.Al-Thani said governments had wide discretion to invoke the national security defence but it had to be subject to oversight.?If it is self-regulating, that is a danger to the entire multilateral trading system itself. And we believe the WTO will take that into consideration.?Qatar also raised the boycott at a meeting of the United Nations? International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on Monday, al-Thani said.In comments to Qatar-based Al Jazeera television later on Monday, Qatar?s transport and information minister said the boycotting countries had discriminated against Doha in violation of an international agreement guaranteeing overflights.?These countries have used this right arbitrarily and imposed it on aircraft registered only in the State of Qatar,? Jassim bin Saif al-Sulaiti said.Qatar in June asked Montreal-based ICAO to resolve the conflict, using a dispute resolution mechanism in the Chicago Convention, a 1944 treaty that created the agency and set basic rules for international aviation.Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain said on Sunday they would allow Qatari planes to use air corridors in emergencies.

Sources said that illegal countrymade pistols are generally manufactured from spare parts of trucks, especially, the lower end of the steering gear, which are shaped into barrels as they are strong and can withstand the firepower.
